Moonlight: Core Support
=======================

	To build Moonlight, you need to install a few dependencies for
	the basic runtime engine (this is needed to support both API
	profiles: Silverlight 1.0 and 2.0).

   * Dependencies:
		
	You must install ffmpeg, from:

		svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk
		Revision: 9167 is known to work

		svn co -r 9167 svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg

		Then configure/make/make install

	You also need the alsa-devel package for Audio support.

	To build a mozilla plugin installer (XPI) configure with
	--enable-user-plugin and build as above.  This modifies the libraries
	to open the libraries it needs from ~/.mozilla/plugins and builds an
	unsigned .xpi file which you may use to install the plugin in your
	browser.

	To install the plugin open the plugin/novell-moonlight.xpi with	your
	mozilla-based browser and follow the prompts.

	Currently this only works properly when moonlight is built without
	mono runtime (Silverlight 2.0) support (--without-mono-runtime).

Configuration Options
=====================

	--enable-user-plugin

		The plugin can be built in two ways: one designed to 
		go into the centralized location for all plugins
		(relative to a prefix directory) or another that works
		from the user's plugin directory (~/.mozilla/plugins/)

		If you use this option, the makefiles will also build
		a Mozilla XPI file that can be used to install the plugin
		without restarting the browser.

		For this to actually work you'll need to build a local version
		of ffmpeg with a few changes, mostly to the way it links.
		A patch is included (ffmpeg.patch) with the neccessary changes.
		PKG_CONFIG_PATH must include your build of ffmpeg when you
		configure moonlight.

	--with-pango-support

		By default Moonlight uses FreeType as its rendering engine
		and does not try to render left-to-right languages or do 
		any advanced glyph rendering.

		Enable pango support to get these features.   

	--with-mono-runtime=yes,no

		By default Moonlight will build the 2.0 profile of Silverlight
		and will try to link with Mono to provide the required managed
		support.

		Use this flag to disable support for Mono from your plugin build.

	--with-ffmpeg=yes,no

		By default Moonlight will build with media support using ffmpeg.

		Use this flag to disable all use of ffmpeg.

Moonlight: Silverlight 2.0 API support
======================================

	If you want to support the Silverlight 2.0 API (managed
	support, this includes the Mono runtime and .NET APIs to run
	apps) you will need in addition to:

		* Install Mono from SVN (you need both the mono and
	  	  mcs modules).

		  Use the --with-moonlight=yes option to configure

		* Install the "olive" module from SVN, and use the
		  --with-moonlight=yes option to configure.
