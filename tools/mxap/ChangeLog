	* Makefile.am: Generate debug info.
	* mxap.cs: Added another flag, allowing to specify cs files listed in a
	  sources file.

	* mxap.cs: Add support for specifying EntryPointType and
	  ApplicationName manually. Removed -pkg switch to smcs, smcs doesn't
	  support that switch anymore. Don't add *.g.cs files which doesn't
	  exist.
