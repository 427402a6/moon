	* mxap.cs: add -l|--list-generated which just outputs the list of
	files mxap would create if you ran it with those flags.

	* mxap.cs: use the builddir version of smcs.exe so it resolves the
	builddir versions of all the class libraries.

2008-12-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* mxap.cs: factor out the builddirhack stuff into RunTool (used
	for things that will be executed from the builddir).

	* mxap.cs: short-circuit out if any step fails to return true (for
	success).  return non-zero status in that case.

2008-12-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* mxap.cs: add --builddirhack=$(top_builddir) hack so that we can
	locate the right .exe's to run to make the desklets without
	installing.

	* mxap.cs: Just escape so we can have cs files in directories.

	* mxap.cs: Make things work with directories that have spaces in
	their names.

2008-11-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* mxap.cs: if --desktop is given, invoke gmcs with the proper
	-pkg: flags instead of using smcs.

	* mxap.cs: update SL2 runtime version.

2008-08-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Makefile.am: Generate debug info.
	* mxap.cs: Added another flag, allowing to specify cs files listed in a
	  sources file.

2008-08-05  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* mxap.cs: Add support for specifying EntryPointType and
	  ApplicationName manually. Removed -pkg switch to smcs, smcs doesn't
	  support that switch anymore. Don't add *.g.cs files which doesn't
	  exist.
