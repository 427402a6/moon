	* xaml2html.cs: Try to be smart and find the master canvas Width/Height
	and use it as the ML object/plugin width/height.

	* xaml2html.cs: Make the html page background color light-gray so that
	it's a little bit different than canvas background. Makes it easier to
	ie. generate masters manually and debug things.

	* xaml2html.cs: Add support to process multiple files and, 
	optionally, chain them (using refresh).
	* Makefile.am: Remove manual reference to System.dll (since it's
	one of the few automatic we have).

	* xaml2html.cs:
	* xaml2html.in:
	* Makefile.am: Adding a trivial tool to convert a .xaml file
	into an .html with embeded xaml.
