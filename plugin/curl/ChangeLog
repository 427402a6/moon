	* curl-bridge.[h|cpp]: added IsDataThread helper method
	* curl-http.[h|cpp]: make aborting threadsafe. if a request is closed
	during header processing when the Started call is still queued on idle,
	wait for it before calling Finished

	* curl-bridge.[h|cpp]: move the multi curl handle up to the bridge
	so all requests are handled by it and all data from all connections
	can be pumped in one call (GetData). data is handled on a separate
	thread, and sent (AddCallback) out to the main thread via g_idle_add
	(Emit). when requests are done, connection handles are cached in a
	pool to be reused when needed.
	* curl-http.[h|cpp]: Add asynchronous support and remove all curl
	actions (except option settings), all work is now done by the bridge

	* curl-http.cpp: strip whitespaces from headers

2010-03-03  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	Curl bridge - olympics support (requires mono-2-6 r152891)

	* curl-bridge.[h|cpp]: add a curl share interface handle so that
	all requests handled by this bridge can share cookie data
	automagically

	* curl-http.[h|cpp]: add support for ssl (no checks for now), posts,
	cookies, getting headers synchronously. also initial asynch support
	(not yet in use), finish the callbacks

2010-02-26  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* curl-bridge.[h|cpp], curl-http.[h|cpp], Makefile.am:
	Curl bridge
