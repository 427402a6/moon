	* firefox-browsermmsh.inc:  Support a proper Describe capability
	request from the MMS server before blindly streaming all streams.
	Store the stream information (bitrate) in the MmshState object.
	Fix the SetBody request to use a ff2 && ff3 compatible construction
	of the outputstream, and to close the stream after constructing it.
	Implment parsing of MMS_PAIR_P packets.
