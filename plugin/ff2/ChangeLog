	* firefox-browsermmsh.inc: Don't g_free tmp_buffer at
	~GECKO_SYM(AsyncBrowserMmshResponse). It is already done at
	browser-bridge.h

2008-05-12  Andrew Jorgensen  <ajorgensen@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Dist ff2-bridge.h as well

2008-05-09  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* firefox-browsermmsh.inc:  Support a proper Describe capability
	request from the MMS server before blindly streaming all streams.
	Store the stream information (bitrate) in the MmshState object.
	Fix the SetBody request to use a ff2 && ff3 compatible construction
	of the outputstream, and to close the stream after constructing it.
	Implment parsing of MMS_PAIR_P packets.
