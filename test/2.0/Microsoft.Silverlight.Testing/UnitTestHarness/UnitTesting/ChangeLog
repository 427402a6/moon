	* ConditionalWorkItem.cs: Add the ability to append a failure
	  message to EnqueueConditional to make it easy to tell which
	  EnqueueConditional fails when a test uses this multiple
	  times.

	* ConditionalWorkItem.cs: Add a timeout value so that waiting
	on a conditional will never block indefinitely.
