	* supp, supp/audio.supp, supp/ffmpeg.supp, supp/firefox.supp,
	  supp/moon.supp: Added suppression files for valgrind.

2008-03-11  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* harness/masters/:
	* xaml/: Removing the storyboard tests...

	* xaml/clock/: ...Instead adding those tests here following the
	existing semantics (adding only the ones which were not already there).

2008-03-06  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/xaml/drtlist.xml: Adding the new storyboard tests to the
	drtlist.

2008-03-06  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* test/xaml/test-storyboard-constrained-autoreverse.xaml:
	* test/xaml/test-storyboard-constrained-fill.xaml:
	* test/xaml/test-storyboard-constrained-stop.xaml: Few more tests for
	clocks/storyboard, this time contrained ones. Contrained as in: the
	storyboard duration is smaller than the duration of it's children
	animations. Not yet added to the drtlist.

2008-03-06  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am>

	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-autoreverse-forever.xaml:
	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-autoreverse.xaml:
	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-fill-fill.xaml:
	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-fill-stop.xaml:
	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-stop-fill.xaml:
	* xaml/test-storyboard-simple-stop-stop.xaml: Adding few base
	clock/storyboard tests. Not yet added to the drtlist.

2008-03-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: Can't delete a surface anymore, unref it.

2008-02-29  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* index.aspx:
	* xamlize.aspx:
	* Silverlight.js: A few helper asp.net pages to test all our tests in here
	in browser.  Simply run "xsp2" in this directory and you'll get a list of 
	all the xamls you can startup.

2008-02-22  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-directory-in-zip.html, xaml/test-directory-in-zip.zip,
	  xaml/test-directory-in-zip.xaml, xaml/test-empty-element-source.html:
	  New test.
	* xaml/Silverlight.js, harness/masters/test-directory-in-zip.htmlMaster.png,
	  harness/masters/test-empty-element-source.htmlMaster.png: Added.
	* xaml/drtlist.xml: Added 2 more tests.

2008-02-21  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* xaml/test-rectangle-fill-with-image-brush.xaml: Add a xaml file that was
	  crashing moonlight.

2008-02-06  Michael Dominic K.  <mdk@mdk.am> 

	* test/harness/xaml2png.cpp: Use GdkPixbuf to save the PNG instead of the
	cairo png saver. Makes it faster by skipping the post-save png loading
	step to strip metadata.

2007-11-05  Larry Ewing  <lewing@novell.com>

	* xaml/test-path-group-stretch.xaml: add some stretched paths with
	incomplete size specifiers.

2007-10-24  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: fill the background with white so we look
	like mopen.  Also, use the MS way of specifying timespecs -
	"100,15" == generate image every 100 milliseconds, up to 15
	images.

2007-10-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp (main): use RUNTIME_INIT_AUDIO_DISABLE so
	we can screenshot video.

2007-10-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: fix up a lot of this.  allow timespans to
	be places on the command line after the xaml file + output file
	args, and use the manual time source to move the timemanager to
	those times before dumping pngs.

2007-10-17  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* harness/Makefile.am (xaml2png_LDADD): add MOON_PROG_LIBS.

2007-09-27  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp (main): Updated runtime_init() call.

2007-09-17  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* harness/xaml2png.cpp: Update according to API change.

2007-06-15  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Fixed so that the download happens in
	Send(), it is not supposed to happen during open.

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Add support for local files
