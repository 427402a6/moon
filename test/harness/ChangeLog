	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs:
	* test-runner/html_template.html: Add supported for expected
	errors.  You can now specify an expected error in the drtlist that
	will be caught by the OnError handler and will have it's error
	type verified.  These will only work with .xaml tests that use the
	html template.

	* test-runner/HtmlTest.cs: Make sure that the substitutions get
	made if there are more than one on a line.

	with the above code.

	useful.
