NON-WORKING

* test-path-group-2.xaml, 

	The XAML parser replace the first GeometryGroup with the second
	instead of merging both. Bug #82612

* test-path-group-stoke.xaml

	Degenerate cases works like individual shapes being rendered (i.e.
	no FillRule is applied) and some geometries can be non-degenerated.
	Note: also suffers from #82612
