	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Adapt to the new downloading framework
	that requires us to notify with a filename where the results have
	been placed. 

	(Download): Now places the file in a temporary file.   The TODO
	file has been updated with thoughts on how to cache this.

	(Start): Special case for files in the local file system, notify
	the downloader immediately of the transfer being finished.
	
	(dowloader_notify_error, downloader_notify_finished): new
	pinvokes, used to notify of completion and errors.
