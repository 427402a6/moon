	* ManagedDownloader.cs: fix this the right way, by keeping the
	local file case, just putting it in the Download delegate.

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: remove the special case for files - it
	breaks the async semantics of the downloader class, and keeps
	mopen from working with monotone.

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Do not use the auto_reset event after the
	finished callback, because the downloader might just trigger a new
	download and we would have pending events in the queue that are
	never executed.    Fixes loop downloaded crash.

	* Makefile: add support for uploading the docs to the server.

	* gtk.cs: Eliminate traces of get_response_func, this is now
	handled in the C++ runtime.

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Do not go the expensive route if we are
	getting a file:// uri, just get directly from the file system.

2007-07-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* ManagedDownloader.cs: Adapt to the new downloading framework
	that requires us to notify with a filename where the results have
	been placed. 

	(Download): Now places the file in a temporary file.   The TODO
	file has been updated with thoughts on how to cache this.

	(Start): Special case for files in the local file system, notify
	the downloader immediately of the transfer being finished.
	
	(dowloader_notify_error, downloader_notify_finished): new
	pinvokes, used to notify of completion and errors.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Fix mopen crash when canvas size is not specified. We should
	have a better stuff for this, just get it working right now.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Use cavas size for silver and window size.

2007-06-25  Everaldo Canuto  <ecanuto@novell.com>

	* mopen.cs: Add support for "--desklet" option, it removes window decoration
	and will add some other desklet related stuff. Also add "--help"
