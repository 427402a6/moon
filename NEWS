=============================================================

* fixes everywhere, including parsing and managed runtime type fixes.

* work on template instantiation with ItemsControl and its subclasses.

* work progressing on ToggleRef implementation.  we're still leaking,
  but not for long.

* TemplateBindings are now created in managed code instead of
  unmanaged, and are exposed with ReadLocalValue.

* Lots of speedups due to caching TLS lookups we do often.
