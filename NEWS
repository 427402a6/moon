Changes from 0.6 to 0.7
=======================

 * The plugin now loads in opera 9.5 (lewing).

 * The stream/downloader/request/response logic (used for downloading
   media) has been been almost entirely moved from the browser bridges
   into libmoon, with the browsers providing subclasses. (kangaroo,
   sde)

 * Many clock/animation framework fixes.  We now pass both animation
   matrix tests, and many, *many* other bugs (and regressions) have
   been fixed. (mdk).

 * Bug fixes in the Stroke{Collection}.HitTest and
   Stroke{Collection}.Bounds code (toshok, sde).

 * Namescope merging fixes (sde, jackson)

 * Parser fixes, and changes paving the way for 2.0 work (jackson)

 * Big, big strides in our media framework and the various (file,
   http, mms) downloaders (fejj, rolf, kangaroo, fer)

 * Finally add argument checking to all wrapped plugin objects (fejj).

 * Windowless mode fixes (lewing, toshok)

 * Plugin event handling fixes (lewing)

 * Fix mouse event bubbling behavior (toshok)

 * Made big gains in performance:

   * Shape caching and bounds computation reduction (spouliot)

   * Geometry bounds work (spouliot)

   * Fast path for position updates (Canvas.Left/Canvas.Top) (toshok)

   * Improved temporary cairo surface bounds (lewing)

   * Glyph rendering (fejj)

   * Resort by ZIndex as a dirty pass, instead of at the time of the
     property change (toshok)

 * 2.0 work is progressing. A very simple 2.0 application successfully
   ran. (miguel, jackson, sde).
