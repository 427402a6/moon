Feel free to add items to this TODO list

* DependecyProperty-fication

	A few components still have instance properties that
	should be handled as dependencyproperties, look into that.

* DependencyProperty:

	When we register a property we should specify the type for
	the property, and validate in SetValue that the value.Kind is
	of the same type as the DependencyProperty

* Video Player:

	Add support for seeking, stopping, shutdown.

	Fix the memory leak that it currently has that brings the 
	system down.

* Reference counting and destruction

	Need to properly shut down the runtime.

* XAML Support

	Add support to each element to be created from a xaml string.

	Need to support attached properties

	XAML needs to be case sensitive

* Paths

	Sam Ruby had some path tests, we could use that as test cases.
