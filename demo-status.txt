* 2D Physics Simulation (http://www.chriscavanagh.com/Chris/Silverlight/Physics2D-1/TestPage.html

	Sorta works.  animations are definitely there, but clicking on
        the wind checkbox doesn't do anything, and firefox keeps
        popping up the "Unresponsive script" dialog.  the checkbox
        being unresponsive might be because the script is eating too
        much cpu?

	Note: page seems empty (possibly wrong plugin)

* 3D Teapot Demo (http://www.dolittle.com/Silverlight/3D/TestPage.html)

	2 things blocking this demo:

	- downloading media from remote servers

		video source changed to `silverlightLogoLoop.wmv'
		cannot open uri `silverlightLogoLoop.wmv': No such file or directory

	- the MediaBase.MediaEnded event needs to be raised when the
	  above .wmv finishes playing.

	Note: URL requires the older (pre release) plugin

* Binary Clock (http://explosivedog.com/silverlight/binaryclock/default.html)

	works!

* Browser Poker (http://support.newsgator.com/nickh/browserpoker/browserpoker.html)

	Starts up, but crashes when it tries to access
	IsolatedStorage.

* Bubble Factory (http://cosmik.members.winisp.net/BubbleFactory/)

	No JS errors.  I get this on the console.

		Assembly not available:  ClientBin/BubbleFactory.dll

		** (Gecko:28016): WARNING **: PARSER ERROR, STOPPING PARSING:  Unable to resolve x:Class type 'BubbleFactory.Game;assembly=ClientBin/BubbleFactory.dll'
		  line: 1   char: 1

* Bubble Mark (http://bubblemark.com/)

	Silverlight (CLR) works!

	Silverlight (Javascript) works too :)

* Comic Book Viewer (http://mycomix.wintellect.com/Spotlight.aspx?Item=1041)

	seems to work.  there is only 1 comic to view.  moving the
	mouse to the top of the page results in a rating and blurb animating
	in from the top. That panel should be on top of the comic (and tranparent),
	not behind it.

	On SL using the mouse-scroll can zoom in and out the comic picture.

* Destroy All Invaders (http://www.andybeaulieu.com/silverlight/DestroyAll/Default.html)

	* Works, but the chopper crashes as soon as the game start.

* Digger (http://www.aisto.com/Roeder/Silverlight/Digger/Default.aspx)

	works.


* Disco Dance Floor (http://explosivedog.com/silverlight/discolights/)

	Comes up, runs slow, and also seems to peg the event loop
	processing in Firefox.

	Although the disco floor is updated and continues to move and
	rotate, the event loop seems to be dominated by it, and
	Mozilla becomes very unresponsive. 

	Note: URL requires the older (pre release) plugin

* Dr. Green Thumb (http://labs.blitzagency.com/?p=50)

	page comes up telling you to install WPF/e.

	Note: same thing happens on SL (web page was updated to confirm this).

* Dr. Popper (http://www.bluerosegames.com/brg/drpopper/)

	comes up, but is unresponsive to mouse clicks.  there's an
	"overlay" canvas over the entire UI which eats all mouse
	events. Not sure how they're passed through on MS.

* Glyph Map (http://www.wynapse.com/Silverlight/Silverlight_GlyphMap_Utility.aspx)

	Some of the UI comes up

* GOA WinForms Demo (http://community.netikatech.com/demos/)

* Gradient Animation Demo (http://www.zillinois.com/blog/2007/05/16/YetAnotherSilverLightXAMLDemo.aspx)

	works!

* Grand Piano (http://silverlight.net/samples/1.0/Grand-Piano/default.html)

	Work remotely.

	If you try to run this locally, nothing shows up, not sure if
	this is our problem. 

* Infragistics Controls Demo (http://labs.infragistics.com/silverlight/)

	Crashes firefox with:

* JavaScript/.NET Chess (http://silverlight.net/samples/1.1/chess/run/default.html)

	This mostly works, with a few exceptions, these are tracked in
	the sldemos/chess/port/issues.txt (support for Javascript
	inside x:Code and animations are not working).
	
* Laugh-o-Sphere (http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/blogs/mikeg/silverlight1/PopflyMashups/bLaugh-o-Sphere.aspx)

	Just shows the "Get Microsoft Silverlight" badge.  plugin version difference?

* Matrix Digital Rain (http://blogs.sqlxml.org/wpfe/matrix/)

	nothing shows in the browser, with this error in the JS console:

		Error: wpfeControl1Host is not defined
		Source File: http://blogs.sqlxml.org/wpfe/matrix/
		Line: 26

	This is actually broken Javascript which relies on IE exposing
	element id's as properties of the page.

	Looking at the javascript in
	http://blogs.sqlxml.org/wpfe/matrix/ shows that this demo
	depends on working Glyph stuff, which we lack.

* Michael's Journal (http://blogs.msdn.com/Synergist/pages/journal.aspx)

* Office Ribbon (http://xmldocs.net/)

	This seems to work now, but the media player seems to get the
	downloaded completed notification many times for the same
	file. 

* Photopoints Gallery (http://www.photopoints.com/main/Silverlight_Alpha/)

	Fails due to missing HtmlPage.DocumentUri (we get a NRE
	because that getter currently always return null).

* Popfly (http://www.popfly.com/)

	Note: requires FF 2.0 minimum (doesn't accept FF 1.5 as a "valid" browser)

* Python Console (http://silverlight.net/Samples/1.1/DLR-Console/python/index.htm)

		ManagedXamlLoader.load_code: 'DLRConsole.py' 'text/python'
		ManagedXamlLoader.load_code: Ignoring request to load code.

* Reflecting Graph (http://davidbetz.net/reflectinggraphdemo/)

	Html controls work, and the graph loads.  is there no way to
	interact with the graph?

* Sierpinski Triangle (http://www.cjcraft.com/silverlight/SierpinskiTriangle/Default.html)

	works!

	note: requires an older version of the plugin.

* Silverlight Airlines Demo (http://delay.members.winisp.net/SilverlightAirlinesDemo/)

	works!

	a few visual glitches, but things should behave as expected.

* Silverlight Chess Game Replay (http://www.vertigo.com/downloads/SilverlightChess/)

	Comes up, displays chess pieces, shows the intro animation.

	Clicking on the "Start Game button" results in the following in the JS Console:

		Error: Error setting property on scriptable plugin object!
		Source File: http://www.vertigo.com/downloads/SilverlightChess/Scene.xaml.js
		Line: 252

	Looks like maybe more namescoping issues?

* Silverlight Mind Map (http://blogs.msdn.com/synergist/pages/silverlight-map.aspx)

	* Seems to work, still the nodes are using the strange Hand Written font.

* Silverlight Pad (http://silverlight.net/samples/1.0/Silverlight-Pad/default.html)

	* Displayed using a strange Hand Written like font.
	* Mouse wheel doesn't zoom.
	* Xaml and JavaScript are not displayed in the bottom tabs.
	* Clicking on items on the left doesn't work.


* Silverlight Rocks (http://www.junkship.org:8000/silverlightdemo/)

	Shows a blue bg, prints:

* Surface Prototype (http://silverlight.schwarz-interactive.de/ex02/)

	seems to load okay, but nothing ever shows.

* SVG to Silverlight Converter (http://intertwingly.net/stories/2007/05/06/?icon=compass)

	works?  seems to work ok, but the plugin might be too large?
	we obscure some of the html (but so does the SVG view of the info).

	Note: application hasn't been updated for SL 1.0 (i.e. it still requires the old plugin)

* Telerik RadControls 3D Cube (http://www.telerik.com/demos/aspnet/silverlight/Cube/Examples/RoomDesigner/DefaultCS.aspx)

	Loads up the background fine but nothing else shows up.

	Firebug reports "this.get_Canvas() has no properties
	this.get_Canvas().setValue("Opacity",this.get_Opacity());"

* Windows Journal-to-Silverlight Converter (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=4964cd5f-0dcb-4c22-9378-773100d8e89f&displaylang=en)

	Windows specific conversion tool.  not a web demo.

* Windows Vista Simulator (http://www.windowsvista.si/)

	Application appears, but nothing happen when clicking on the FreeTime or WorkTime graphics.
	No tooltip appear when I leave the mouse on those either.

* XamlWebPad (http://xamlwebpad.peterkellner.net/Default.aspx)

	works!  or appears to anyway.

* XPSViewer (http://delay.members.winisp.net/SimpleSilverlightXpsViewer/)

	* Visually works. Yet it triggers a NotImplementedException that the application
	catches, but doesn't give more details about it yet.

	http://www.aisto.com/Roeder/Silverlight/

	Works. At least better than Silverlight which crashes on this for me.
