      Mono.Desklets is a set of tools to run small applications built
      with Moonlight/Silverlight(tm) on your Linux desktop using
      Mono's Moonlight.

         Desklets are basically Silverlight applications that have
         been transported from the Web to the desktop.   Unlike their
         Web counterparts, these desklets run with the full Mono API,
         not the subset that is part of Silverlight and they run with
         full trust on the desktop.

         To launch a desklet you would typically use the mopen command
         or double click on the default.xaml file on your desktop (if
         the mopen command has been associated with the XAML mime type
         in your Linux installation).

       <para>
         A simple desklet can be as simple as a XAML file with
         animations embedded into it.  But most desklets will likely
         have some logic written in another language to add the
         special behaviour for each desklet.  To do this, you
         typically reference an assembly from your XAML file and
         specify the namespace that will instantiate this class (using
         the x:Class attribute in your toplevel Canvas declaration
         referencing the assembly, like this:
         x:Class="Clock.Display;assembly=bin/clock.dll").  You can use
         the Loaded property of any of the UIElements to trigger the
         execution of a particular method in the assembly, for
         example: Loaded="PageLoaded".

         The following sample shows how things would look like in the
         C# side of things:
       </para>
       <example>
         <code lang="C#">
namespace Clock {

        public class Display : Canvas {
                public void PageLoaded(object o, EventArgs e)
		{
			// C# code goes here
		}	
        }
}
	 </code>
