	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateManager.cs: Update VSM so that
	  it doesn't fail completely for PropertyPaths which were
	  instaniated in managed land with a DependencyProperty
	  argument.

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateManager.cs: The PathParameters
	  supplied to PropertyPath are always guaranteed to be of
	  length 0. There is no point in storing them, exposing them
	  or comparing them.

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateGroup.cs: Default the name to "".

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualState.cs: use a hack to get around our
	lack of support for RuntimeNameProperty (use the
	DependencyObject.NameProperty for Name for the time being.)

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateManager.cs: dubious change - the
	type Collection<VisualStateGroup> is *mostly* hidden, and is
	reflected as IList to managed code.  so let's take advantage of
	this fact to make things MUCH easier on us, and make it a subclass
	of PresentationFrameworkCollection<VisualStateGroup>.

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateGroup.cs: Simplify how native events are
	connected to in managed code. The managed add/remove event methods
	just call RegisterEvent/UnregisterEvent defined in DO.cs instead of
	each event managing the event list itself.

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateGroup.cs,
	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualTransition.cs: Fix API to match SL2

	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateChangedEventArgs.cs:
	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateGroup.cs:
	* VSM/System/Windows/VisualStateManager.cs: Various changes to
	integrate those WPF.Toolkits parts in our System.Windows.dll
