	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Implement DispatcherTimer using an internal
	class (Mono.DispatcherTimer).

2008-12-11  Andreia Gaita <shana@jitted.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherOperation.cs: Implement Dispatcher. It now
	  registers delegates to one list of DispatcherOperations and adds a
	  single tick call for a callback that handles all the operations on the
	  list. DispatcherOperation is just a wrapper for a delegate and
	  it's arguments. Dispatcher also includes a synchronous Invoke method
	  for internal use, so our code can also use the Dispatcher when it needs
	  to do synchronous calls to the ui thread from ui or non-ui threads without
	  worrying whether it's on the right thread or not.

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: timer_callback: Catch all exceptions. Prevents
	  mono from crashing due to exceptions crossing managed-native
	  boundary.

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherTimer.cs: Use the time manager
	to register our idle calls and timeouts.

	initial implementation supporting simple dispatcher operations
	posted to the main thread.

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: g_timout_add based implementation of

2008-08-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherSynchronizationContext.cs: Changed some
	  parameter names, base types, method signatures, etc to match SL.
