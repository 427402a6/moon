	* SendFailedException.cs: add a string arg to the ctor.

	* SendCompletedEventArgs.cs: add an Exception arg to the ctor, and
	pass it along to the base class.  Also, make the user state
	handling more robust.

	* LocalMessageReceiver.cs (ctor): the 1 arg ctor defaults to
	Domain namescope, not Global.
	(Listen): remove spew.
	(Dispose): remove spew.

	* ListenFailedException.cs: make this ctor take a message so we
	can get some more info about it.

	* LocalMessageReceiver.cs, LocalMessageSender.cs,
	MessageReceivedEventArgs.cs, SendCompletedEventArgs.cs: pretty
	much functional implementation.
