	* Makefile.am: compile tools with --debug

2009-04-23  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* detect-sc.cs: Call AddSearchDirectory on the input directory

2009-03-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* Makefile.am: Use the plugin directory as the assembly source
	to analyze.

2009-03-27  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* detect-sc.cs: Handle interfaces and method overrides since the
	rules for [SecurityCritical] makes it impossible to have them 
	differs. This is not a problem for [SecuritySafeCritical] since 
	the override rules are more lax.

2009-03-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* detect-sc.cs: The idea of SC API with IntPtr (to reduce the
	number of SSC to audit) was not a good one. It reduced the ones
	in System.Windows.dll but added quite more elsewhere. Removing
	this saves about 100 SSC (total). Also avoid signature checks
	on visible API so we don't add extra SC where SL don't have them.
	* Makefile.am: Fix 'validate' target to let us compare the end
	result of applying the security attributes with the public API
	of Silverlight.

	* CecilRocks.cs: Fix logic for IsSecurity[Safe]Critical rocks

2009-03-12  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Adjust detect target to look at a single directory
	since all assemblies are now available from a single location.
	Make the stored data files a dependency to re-merge the attributes

2009-03-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile: Remove. Replacedby Makefile.am
	* Makefile.am: New

2009-02-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* merge.cs: Smarter merge to avoid duplicate (or unneeded) attributes
	on methods when a type is decorated with SC or SSC.

2009-02-25  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* merge.cs: Avoid duplicates in the merged files (e.g. an SC from
	both compatibility and automatic).

2009-02-19  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* detect-sc.cs, detect-ssc.cs: Accept multiple input directories
	to find the platform assemblies (and deal with the current /mcs
	and /moon locations).
	* Makefile.am: Detect platform assemblies in {x}/mcs and {x}/moon

2009-02-17  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* detect-sc.cs: Tool to detect methods that *likely* needs a
	[SecurityCritical] attribute to execute under the CoreCLR
	* detect-ssc.cs: Tool to detect methods that *likely* needs a
	[SecuritySafeCritical] attribute to execute under the CoreCLR
	* find-sc.cs: Tool to extract types and methods decorated with
	[SecurityCritical] in Silverlight platform code.
	* merge.cs: Tool to merge the different data files into files (one
	per assembly) usable by the tuner.
	* PlatformCode.cs: Helpers for tools.
	* CecilRocks.cs: Extension methods helpers for tools.
	* Makefile: Build file. Normally only the merging should be done.
	Other options needs "supervision" ;-) and store their data into 
	SVN to allow tracking/auditing all changes. Note: this is not (yet)
	part of the main build.
	* README: Documentation about the files.
