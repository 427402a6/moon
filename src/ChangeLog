	* shape.cpp: Fix typo.

	* ffvideo.cpp: No longer use CMD_INITED, instead use g_idle_add to
	notify a special function (callback_video_inited).  Makes me
	wonder if I should do the same for the new-frame call

	Initialize the cairo surface on the callback_video_inited routine
	instead of doing this on the decoder thread (that was a mistake).

	This solves the misterious case of the video that randomly did not
	show up.

	* video.cpp (load_next_frame): reimplement the video play back
	logic so that it will now properly paint the proper frame on the
	screen as needed.

	Add logic to skip frames if video is playing back too slowly, and
	to resume playback when new frames are ready.

	Currently its computing the delay using the n_frame_rate field
	(which no sample uses, but I could not find any other way of
	estimating the frame rate other than this.

	It works at least with some sample streams that I have with 30 fps
	and 15 fps.

	* runtime.cpp: Move the GtkDrawingArea widget into the Surface,
	and handle exposes in the runtime, not in the demo.   Show the
	widget (thats why I was not getting the expose events on the
	widget, duh). 

2007-05-26  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@novell.com>

	* runtime.cpp (Brush, SolidBrush): Introduce brushes. 

	(Shape): introduce reusable drawing framework for shapes, not
	complete. 
	
	(Line): introduce second user besides rectangles. 

	Remove agg test code.

	(Group::getbounds): implement.
